                <h2>Motivation</h2>

                <p>

                Our visualization framework enables a program analyst to
                understand inputs generated as part of a program testing
                campaign (also called fuzzing). To ensure a successful test,
                the generate inputs should actuate, or “cover,” as much of the
                original program as possible. While many tools exist to
                automatically generate inputs for this type of testing, they
                typically have poorly-designed user interfaces which prevent an
                analyst from understanding how their testing campaign is
                performing over time.

                To solve this problem, we have created an interactive visualization showing how
                much of a program is covered by fuzzer-generated inputs over time. Using a
                series of provided scripts, an analyst can transform their fuzzing campaign
                into input data for the visualization and then explore the data and gain a
                better understanding of what’s going on.

                Our visualization enables an analyst to quickly see how well individual
                functions within a program are being tested over time and how significant each
                of those functions are. An analyst can then select any function of interest to
                see additional coverage information about the code within the selected
                function.

                Through our visualization, we hope to help analysts understand both where their
                testing is failing and when it stops getting new results. Through interviews
                with our expert, we believe this visualization accomplishes this goal.

                    <h2>Task Analysis</h2>
                    <p>

                    We learned through the interview that current fuzzing
                    softwares are mostly text-based and employ very basic
                    visualization types (such as charts etc.). Our interviewee
                    expressed a desire to have a tool which could help him
                    understand when to stop a particular fuzzing campaign. What
                    this meant in terms of domain tasks were (i) finding out
                    whether the program coverage is improving over time, (ii)
                    analyzing the set of inputs with similar program coverage,
                    (iii) locating the areas in program which do not get any
                    coverage, and (iv) pinpointing input files with anomalous
                    coverage paths. We focused on the first three tasks for our
                    visualizations.

                    <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                    <p>

                    Our analysis of visualizations generated for the program
                    TinyExpr show that: 

                    <ul>
                        <li>

                            Some blocks do not get covered by any input file. By
                            identifying the peculiarities of these blocks, users can
                            modify their input generation strategies to improve the
                            fuzzing campaign effectiveness.    

                        </li>

                        <li>

                            The cumulative program coverage improves drastically for
                            the initial set of input files, and is then followed by a
                            plateau. This indicates that the fuzzer was unable to
                            overcome some critical conditional check, preventing it
                            from exploring deeper regions of the code.

                    <p>
                    
                    We made a couple of changes to our initial design proposal
                    based on the feedback we got in the usability testing
                    phase. Specifically, some of the users were having trouble
                    noticing all the features of the visualization. We fixed
                    that by highlighting the default options for all those
                    features signaling users they could change them. Other than
                    that, we noticed that there was no way for the users to see
                    whether a particular function would ever get covered
                    without having to run the whole visualization. We fixed
                    that by presenting line charts for program and function
                    coverage over all inputs.
